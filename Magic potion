// Input:
//   ABABCABABCE
//Output:
//   6
//Explanation:
//    In the first part, ABAB, AB has repeated twice and it can be replaced as AB* and similarly ABABC is repeated twice and so it can be encoded as AB*C*. 
//    The last character is placed as it is and the final encoded format would be AB*C*E and so the length of the minimum encoded string is 6.

            // If repeated use the length of the first block + 1 (for *)
            dp[i] = dp[i / 2] + 1;
        } else {
            // If not just increment

/**
* Checks if string is repeated in i..j and j+1..k

Initialization:

n = ingredients.length() calculates the length of the ingredients string.
int[] dp = new int[n]; creates an array dp of size n to store the minimal steps needed up to each index i in ingredients.
dp[0] = 1; initializes the first element of dp to 1, assuming the minimal steps to process the first character.
Iteration:

The for loop iterates from 1 to n-1 (for each character in ingredients):
if (i % 2 == 1 && (repeatString(ingredients, 0, i / 2, i))) checks if i is an odd index and whether the substring from 0 to i/2 repeats in the substring from i/2 + 1 to i.
If the substring is repeated, dp[i] = dp[i / 2] + 1; calculates the minimal steps needed as the steps to reach i/2 plus 1 additional step for the '*'.
If not repeated, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1; calculates the steps by simply incrementing the steps needed up to i-1.
Return:

return dp[n-1]; returns the minimal steps required to process the entire ingredients string.

/**
 * Checks if string is repeated in i..j and j+1..k
 */
private static boolean repeatString(String s, int i, int j, int k) {
    return s.substring(i, j+1).equals(s.substring(j+1, k+1));
}
Explanation:
Method Purpose: Checks if the substring from i to j in string s is repeated in the substring from j+1 to k.
Logic:
s.substring(i, j+1) extracts the substring from index i to j (inclusive).
s.substring(j+1, k+1) extracts the substring from index j+1 to k (inclusive).
equals() compares these two substrings to check if they are identical.
