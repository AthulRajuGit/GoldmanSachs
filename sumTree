Given a Binary Tree. Return true if, for every node X in the tree other than the leaves, its value is equal to the sum of its left subtree's value and its right subtree's value
. Else return false. An empty tree is also a Sum Tree as the sum of an empty tree can be considered to be 0. A leaf node is also considered a Sum Tree.

Java Implementation
class Solution
{
	public boolean isSumTree(TreeNode root){
        return isSumT(root) != -1;
	}
    private long isSumT(Node root) {
		if(root == null){
          return 0;
        }
        
        long left = isSumT(root.left);
        long right = isSumT(root.right);
        
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null){
            return root.val;
        }
        
        if(left ==-1  || right == -1 || root.val != left + right){
          return -1;
        }
        return left + right + root.val;
      
	}
}
